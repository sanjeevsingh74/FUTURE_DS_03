# ROAD ACCCIDENT ANALYSIS 

Project Overview

Despite implementing traffic regulations and road safety campaigns, the borough of Kensington and Chelsea continues to report a significant number of road accidents. The Transport Safety Authority needs to understand:
What factors contribute most to road accidents? Where and when do these occur the most? And how can we reduce them effectively?

This project is aimed at analyzing road accident data and identifying trends and insights related to casualties. The project will leverage several key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the severity and the total number of casualties by accident severity, vehicle type, road type, and other factors.

# üß© Project Objective

As a government department focused on road safety and accident reduction, we‚Äôre overwhelmed by growing accidents. We lack real-time insights to act on risky locations, accident types, times, and weather conditions. We want a smart accident analytics dashboard to improve public safety, infrastructure planning, and emergency response.

**Business Case:**
The business case for this project is to help transportation authorities, law enforcement agencies, and other stakeholders improve traffic safety and reduce the number of casualties caused by road accidents. By analyzing accident data and identifying trends and patterns, these stakeholders can implement targeted interventions to improve road safety and reduce the risk of accidents.

Goal:
The goal of this project is to analyze traffic accident data and identify key trends and insights related to casualties. By doing so, the project aims to inform policy and decision-making related to road safety, and ultimately help reduce the number of casualties caused by accidents.

KPIs:
Primary KPI:
Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year (CY) and YoY growth

## Recommendation and Action Plan Summary
Objective:
To improve road safety, reduce accident rates, and minimize fatalities by implementing data-driven strategies based on detailed analysis of road accident trends.

üõ£Ô∏è 1. Infrastructure Improvements
High-Risk Zones: Install better lighting, speed bumps, and clear signage in accident-prone areas.

Road Conditions: Regular maintenance of roads with poor surface conditions (e.g., potholes, uneven surfaces).

Pedestrian Safety: Construct foot over-bridges, zebra crossings, and pedestrian signals near accident hotspots.

üöì 2. Law Enforcement Enhancements
Speed Monitoring: Deploy speed cameras and enforce speed limits in areas with frequent speeding violations.

Alcohol Checkpoints: Increase DUI checkpoints during peak accident times (e.g., weekends, late nights).

Helmet and Seatbelt Enforcement: Intensify checks and penalties for non-compliance.

üß† 3. Awareness & Education Campaigns
Launch public awareness programs focused on:

Drunk driving consequences.

Mobile phone usage while driving.

Importance of helmets and seat belts.

Conduct workshops in schools and colleges to promote road safety habits.

‚è±Ô∏è 4. Time-Based Resource Allocation
Peak Hour Patrols: Increase police presence during morning and evening rush hours.

Weekend Measures: Special focus on weekends when accidents due to intoxication or overspeeding rise.

üìä 5. Data-Driven Monitoring
Set up a real-time accident data monitoring dashboard for authorities.

Encourage accident reporting and integrate data from hospitals, police, and transport departments.

Conduct monthly reviews based on updated KPIs and incident patterns.

ü§ù 6. Collaboration with Stakeholders
Involve city planners, transport departments, health services, and NGOs for joint safety initiatives.

Partner with navigation apps to alert users about high-risk areas in real-time.

‚úÖ Expected Impact:
Reduction in fatalities and serious injuries.

Improved emergency response in high-risk zones.

Safer roads and better public awareness of traffic rules.
