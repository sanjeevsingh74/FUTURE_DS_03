Project Overview

This project is aimed at analyzing road accident data and identifying trends and insights related to casualties. The project will leverage several key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the severity and the total number of casualties by accident severity, vehicle type, road type, and other factors.

Business Case:
The business case for this project is to help transportation authorities, law enforcement agencies, and other stakeholders improve traffic safety and reduce the number of casualties caused by road accidents. By analyzing accident data and identifying trends and patterns, these stakeholders can implement targeted interventions to improve road safety and reduce the risk of accidents.

Goal:
The goal of this project is to analyze traffic accident data and identify key trends and insights related to casualties. By doing so, the project aims to inform policy and decision-making related to road safety, and ultimately help reduce the number of casualties caused by accidents.

KPIs:
Primary KPI:
Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year (CY) and YoY growth

Primary KPI's
