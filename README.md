# ROAD ACCCIDENT ANALYSIS 

Project Overview

Despite implementing traffic regulations and road safety campaigns, the borough of Kensington and Chelsea continues to report a significant number of road accidents. The Transport Safety Authority needs to understand:
What factors contribute most to road accidents? Where and when do these occur the most? And how can we reduce them effectively?

This project is aimed at analyzing road accident data and identifying trends and insights related to casualties. The project will leverage several key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the severity and the total number of casualties by accident severity, vehicle type, road type, and other factors.

# ðŸ§© Project Objective

As a government department focused on road safety and accident reduction, weâ€™re overwhelmed by growing accidents. We lack real-time insights to act on risky locations, accident types, times, and weather conditions. We want a smart accident analytics dashboard to improve public safety, infrastructure planning, and emergency response.

**Business Case:**
The business case for this project is to help transportation authorities, law enforcement agencies, and other stakeholders improve traffic safety and reduce the number of casualties caused by road accidents. By analyzing accident data and identifying trends and patterns, these stakeholders can implement targeted interventions to improve road safety and reduce the risk of accidents.

Goal:
The goal of this project is to analyze traffic accident data and identify key trends and insights related to casualties. By doing so, the project aims to inform policy and decision-making related to road safety, and ultimately help reduce the number of casualties caused by accidents.

KPIs:
Primary KPI:
Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year (CY) and YoY growth
